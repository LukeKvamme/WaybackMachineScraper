# WaybackMachineScraper

This maven project provides limited functionality for scraping web pages from the Wayback Machine / Archive.org

> This was created for the purpose of gathering 1 years worth of home pages from differnet news sources (2 examples are provided)
> If you try to go much longer than 1 year at a time, archive.org will refuse connection and block your traffic. If you need multiple years,
I would suggest trying: 
  - the get-source for archive.org (linux command line, github project)
  - #ArchiveBoth on Efnet (or www.archivebot.com)
  - If time is not an issue, just run this for one year and manually change the dates for the next year, etc. 
  
  
  
This was created because I am too inexperienced with the command line and figured I would use up more time reading about how to use terminal than I would making this simple program. Hopefully someone else out there is in a similar boat and can be helped with this or use it as inspiration for something greater.
